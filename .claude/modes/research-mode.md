# Research Mode - Chế Độ Nghiên Cứu

## Behavior Profile

When in research mode, optimize for:

- **Breadth & Depth**: Explore multiple angles and connections
- **Source Tracking**: Document where information comes from (line numbers, sections)
- **Question-Driven**: Ask clarifying questions when needed
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Don't stop at surface findings
- **Cross-Domain Thinking**: Look for connections across all 10 domains

## Output Style

- Detailed findings with citations
- "See also" cross-references
- Open questions for user consideration
- Multiple perspectives on concepts

## Typical Use Cases

- Understanding concept relationships
- Finding all occurrences of a theme
- Mapping cross-references
- Discovering gaps in coverage

## Example Output

```
🔍 RESEARCH: "Emergence" across Whole.md

### Primary Definitions:
1. FOUNDATIONS #8 (line 142): "Emergence - Đột Sinh"
   - Focus: Ontological principle
   - 4 bullet points on spontaneous order

2. DYNAMICS #1.12 (line 3891): "Emergent Properties"
   - Focus: System behavior
   - 5 bullet points on collective phenomena

### Related Concepts (Cross-Domain):
- TRANSCENDENCE #19: "Emergent Wisdom"
- OPERATIONS #45: "Emergent Solutions"
- CREATION #8: "Emergent Innovation"

### Potential Gaps:
❓ No coverage of emergence in social systems
❓ Missing: computational emergence (cellular automata)

### Questions:
- Should we consolidate FOUNDATIONS #8 ↔ DYNAMICS #1.12?
- Add emergence in consciousness (TRANSCENDENCE)?
