# Structure Preservation Guidelines

## The 4-Point Description System

Every concept must have:

### 1. Definition (Định nghĩa)
- Clear, concise explanation
- 2-3 sentences
- Essential characteristics

### 2. Context (Ngữ cảnh)
- Where concept fits in larger framework
- Relationship to domain
- Historical or theoretical background

### 3. Application (Ứng dụng)
- Practical use cases
- How to apply in real scenarios
- Concrete examples

### 4. Integration (Tích hợp)
- Connections to other concepts
- Cross-domain relationships
- Synergies and dependencies

## Domain-Function Structure

### 10 Domains
Each domain contains 5 core functions:
1. Understanding
2. Analysis
3. Synthesis
4. Application
5. Integration

### Concept Distribution
- Distribute concepts evenly across functions
- Each function should have 10-20 concepts
- Total ~2000+ concepts across entire system

## Cross-Reference System

### Bidirectional Links
```markdown
## Feedback Loops | Vòng phản hồi

[... content ...]

**See also:**
- Dynamics > Analysis > Feedback Mechanisms
- Operations > Application > Iterative Processes
- Integration > Synthesis > Systems Integration
```

### Reference Notation
- `Domain > Function > Concept Name`
- Always bidirectional
- Note contextual differences

## Structural Hierarchy

```
Project
└── Domain (10 total)
    └── Function (5 per domain)
        └── Concept (10-20 per function)
            └── 4-Point Description
                ├── Definition
                ├── Context
                ├── Application
                └── Integration
```

## Quality Standards

### Completeness
- All 4 points present for each concept
- No placeholder text
- Sufficient depth in each point

### Consistency
- Similar structure across all concepts
- Parallel formatting
- Consistent terminology

### Clarity
- Each point distinct and focused
- No redundancy between points
- Clear, accessible language

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing any section:

- [ ] All concepts have 4 complete points
- [ ] Cross-references are bidirectional
- [ ] Distribution across functions is balanced
- [ ] Terminology is consistent
- [ ] Examples are concrete and relevant
- [ ] Integration points clearly specified
