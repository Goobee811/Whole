# Duplicate Resolution Guide

## Detection Criteria
**Exact Match**: Same English name across domains
**Similar Match**: >70% word overlap in names

## Decision Framework

### Keep Separate (Meaningful Diversity)
- Concept serves different purposes in different domains
- Context significantly alters the meaning
- Primary function differs
- Natural user thinking patterns require both

Example: "Feedback" in Dynamics (mechanisms) vs Operations (processes)

### Consolidate (True Redundancy)
- Content is essentially identical
- Context doesn't meaningfully differ
- One location is clearly primary

## Consolidation Process
1. Identify primary location (natural fit)
2. Preserve ALL unique information from both
3. Add "See also" reference from secondary location
4. Update all cross-references pointing to consolidated concept
5. Document contextual variations if any

## Report Format
```
## Duplicate Analysis: [Concept Name]

**Locations:**
- Domain A > Function X
- Domain B > Function Y

**Decision:** Keep Separate / Consolidate

**Rationale:** [explanation based on criteria]

**Action Plan:** [if consolidating, describe process]
