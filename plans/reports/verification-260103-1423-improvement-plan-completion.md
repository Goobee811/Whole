## VI. CONCLUSIONS

### Main Findings

1. ✅ **Plan Execution Confirmed:** The improvement plan dated 01/01/2026 has been successfully implemented in Whole.md

2. ✅ **Concept Additions Verified:** All 28 new concepts have been added to the specified functions with correct distribution

3. ⚠️ **Minor Discrepancy:** CF40 has 9 groups instead of claimed 10, but concept count is correct (61)

4. ✅ **Quality Standards Met:** All additions follow bilingual format and 4-point structure requirements

5. ✅ **Target Achievement:** Based on verified improvements, the coherence target of ~93%+ appears to have been met

### Recommendations

1. **CF40 Group Count Investigation:** Review whether baseline was miscounted in plan or if groups were merged during implementation

2. **Rerun Bottom-Up Analysis:** To confirm actual coherence score reached ~93%+ as estimated

3. **Archive Plan:** Move `improvement-260101-sub-domain-coherence-plan.md` to completed plans with this verification report

4. **Update Progress Tracker:** Ensure `.whole-progress.json` reflects the 28 new concept additions
