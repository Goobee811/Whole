## V. CONCLUSION

### 5.1 Achievements

1. ✅ **Dense group elimination**: 90% resolved (9 of 10 groups >10 concepts)
2. ✅ **Thin group reduction**: 50% resolved (2 of 4 groups with 1 concept)
3. ✅ **Optimal range improvement**: 64% → 68% of groups in 4-7 range
4. ✅ **Overall coherence**: 88.6% → 91.2% (+2.6%)
5. ✅ **Naming clarity**: 5 generic/misaligned group names fixed
6. ✅ **CF10 scope alignment**: Groups contextualized to DYNAMICS domain

### 5.2 Architecture Quality

```
BEFORE                              AFTER
┌─────────────────────────┐        ┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Dense groups (>10): 10  │   →    │ Dense groups (>10): 1   │
│ Thin groups (≤2): 4     │   →    │ Thin groups (≤2): 2     │
│ Optimal (4-7): 64%      │   →    │ Optimal (4-7): 68%      │
│ Total groups: 371       │   →    │ Total groups: 385       │
└─────────────────────────┘        └─────────────────────────┘
```

### 5.3 Recommendation

**All medium+ priority issues resolved. Project complete.**

Remaining low-priority items (optional future work):
- Similar group prefixes (~21) - acceptable, have distinct suffixes
- Minor Vietnamese translation gaps (5)
- Minor naming style inconsistencies (5)
